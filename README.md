# VEsNA

**VEsNA** is a framework for managing **V**irtual **E**nvironments via **N**atural Language **A**gents. It is composed of three pieces:

1. **Rasa** for the NLP;
2. **JaCaMo** for the Multi-Agent System;
3. **Godot** for the Virtuale Environment.

What can you do in practice now:

- Use natural language to describe a scene
  - Add objects in different positions
  - Remove objects
- Monitor the conversation

What will be deployed in the future?

- More actions;
- "Actors": people inside the scene that can be inserted, moved and instructed. The MAS will give intelligence to people, allowing users to give abstract tasks;
- More scenes.

More and more going on...
